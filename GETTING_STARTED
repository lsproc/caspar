* GETTING STARTED *

The Caspar framework is found in the caspar/ subfolder of the download (or in
the repository on github).

In addition to this, there are two other main folders:
 * "application" - this is where your application is located, including routing
                   configuration, database configuration, class files, etc.

 * "public" - this is the webroot folder. You can either set up url rewriting
              so this folder is the documentroot for the server where your
              application is located, or edit the public/index.php so the
              basepath (CASPAR_PATH) is correct.

Caspar expects the application/ subfolder to be located next to the caspar
folder. If you want to put the Caspar framework files in one central location
to be used by all your applications, you can specify a custom
CASPAR_APPLICATION_PATH in public/index.php.
